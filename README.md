# serverless-event-announcement-website
A scalable, serverless web application developed on AWS to manage event announcements. This project leverages S3 for static site hosting, Lambda and API Gateway for the backend logic, and SNS for handling user subscriptions and sending out real-time email notifications. It's a great example of a cost-effective, event-driven architecture.
