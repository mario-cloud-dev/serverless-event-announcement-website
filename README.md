Building a Serverless Event Announcement System with AWS

Hey everyone! I'm excited to show off my latest project: a fully serverless web app that I built from the ground up on AWS to serve as a robust and cost-effective solution to manage and send out event notifications without the headache of managing servers. It's a project that allowed me to gain practical experience with a full-stack serverless workflow. It was a ton of fun to build!


Key AWS Services Utilized

This application was built using a suite of essential AWS services, demonstrating a hands-on understanding of cloud-native development:
* Amazon S3: The foundation of the project, serving as the robust and scalable host for all static website files.
* AWS Lambda: The core of the backend logic, utilizing event-driven functions to handle application processes without the need for server management.
* Amazon API Gateway: This service acts as the secure entry point for the application, creating a REST API that connects the web interface to the backend Lambda functions.
* Amazon SNS: Implemented for its ability to handle fan-out messaging, this service manages user subscriptions and distributes real-time email notifications for new events.
* IAM (Identity and Access Management): Used to define and enforce fine-grained permissions, ensuring secure access between all AWS services within the project.



A Short Guide on How to Make the Project

This project creates a website that handles event notifications without needing to manage any traditional servers. The process can be broken down into three main parts:
1. The Frontend: You create a simple website with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website is then hosted on Amazon S3, which is a highly scalable and low-cost way to serve static files to a global audience.
2. The Backend: The logic for your application is handled by AWS Lambda functions. Instead of a dedicated server, these functions run only when they are needed. They are connected to the website through Amazon API Gateway, which creates secure endpoints for your functions.
3. The Notifications: The project uses Amazon SNS to handle email subscriptions and notifications. When a user subscribes, their email is added to an SNS topic. When a new event is created, a message is sent to that topic, and SNS automatically sends an email to every subscriber.



How to Deploy and Test

To get this project running, you will need to:
* Update the index.html file with your specific API Gateway endpoints for the subscribe and create-event functions.
* After updating the file, deploy it to your S3 bucket.


Real-World Scenario

Imagine a small community center or a local club that needs a simple, low-cost way to announce upcoming events like workshops or meetings.
* They can use this system to let members subscribe to event updates by simply entering their email on the website.
* Whenever a new event is added (e.g., "Monthly Book Club Meeting"), an event organizer can use the website to enter the details.
* The system then automatically sends an email notification to everyone who has subscribed.
This solution is perfect because it's cost-effective (you only pay for the services you use), scalable (it can handle thousands of subscribers without any changes), and reliable (it leverages the robust infrastructure of AWS).
